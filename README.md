# restaurant-app

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development
- Once the project is checked out, run the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies(defined in package.json) of the project locally(a folder node_modules will be generated).
      Note: Crosscheck if all the dependencies are successfully installed under node_modules(each dependency defined in package.json should have one folder created under it..if not try installing the missed ones separately, like "npm install grunt-contrib-connect@0.9.0" etc,.)
- Run 'grunt serve' for preview(run with --verbose option to know additional details if errors are thrown)
      You can see application opened in browser (at localhost:9000) itself once above cmd is successful
## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
